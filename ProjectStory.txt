"Imagine you're tasked with building a real-time analytics platform for a ride-hailing service, something like Uber or Lyft. The business needs a live dashboard that shows critical metrics like the number of trips in each city, the average fare, and so on.

(The Problem & Goal) So, the challenge is clear: How do we get that real-time data from the source, transform it, and present it on a live dashboard?

(The Solution - The Big Picture) I tackled this by building a streaming ETL pipeline. At its core, this pipeline moves data from the point of generation to a dashboard, all in real-time. It's designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to manage.

(The First Act: The Source)

The story begins with the producer. To simulate the ride-hailing service, I wrote a Python script using the Faker library. This script generates realistic-looking trip events, like a new ride starting, or a ride ending in a certain city.
Because this is a streaming pipeline, the producer doesn't send the data directly to the processing engine. This is where the story takes an interesting turn. We introduce Kafka, the central message broker.
(The Second Act: Kafka - The Decoupler)

Kafka acts as a highly scalable data buffer and a decoupling layer. The producer publishes the trip data to Kafka, which then reliably stores that data. This decoupling means the producer and the consumer (the Spark job) don't have to know about each other or depend on each other being available.
This is crucial because:
It handles any intermittent issues on either end of the pipeline.
It allows multiple consumers to read the same data (e.g., for different dashboards, or for archiving).
(The Third Act: Spark Streaming - The Transformation Factory)

The heart of the pipeline is an Apache Spark Structured Streaming job. This is where the data gets transformed.
The spark job pulls from Kafka's queue. First, it parses and validates the data. Then, it uses Spark's DataFrames to do the real processing.
The main part is the windowed aggregations: It groups the data by city and calculates key metrics like total trips and average fare for each 1-minute interval. I used Spark's built-in windowing functions, along with a 10-minute watermark, to deal with the late-arriving trips.
(Side note: To make this work, I had to make sure my Java version was set up to allow Spark to function, as well as versioning in requirements.txt files).
(The Fourth Act: PostgreSQL - The Data Warehouse)

Once Spark has processed the trip data, the results are sent to a PostgreSQL database, a robust open-source relational database.
The Spark job writes the results to Postgres. The key part here is, I used a pattern of idempotent database writes. To prevent data corruption, I had to be sure that re-running a batch of data wouldn't create duplicates. I achieved this with the INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE pattern: it either inserts a new row if the city doesn't exist or updates the existing row if it does.
(The Fifth Act: Power BI - The Visual Storyteller)

Finally, I connected a Power BI dashboard to the PostgreSQL database using DirectQuery. This creates a live view. The Power BI dashboard then visualizes the results, showing the number of trips per city, average fares, and other key metricsâ€”all updating in real-time.
(The Epilogue: Orchestration with Prefect)

To make the whole thing production-ready, I used Prefect to orchestrate and manage the data pipeline. Prefect handles the scheduling, monitoring, and error handling of both the data producer and the Spark job, all from one central dashboard. Prefect ensures if a job fails, it retries. It gives us a visual representation of what's going on, at a glance.
(The Lessons Learned)

Along the way, I had to deal with version conflicts and various troubleshooting challenges, like ensuring that the different components could successfully connect to each other. (This is where you highlight the dependency/versioning issues you solved, as in the "Biggest Challenge" answer).
Building this pipeline reinforced the importance of good software engineering practices, especially:
Decoupling in the design.
Idempotency in the writes.
Strong error handling and proper dependency management.
(The Future)

If I had more time, I'd add a full testing suite to ensure data quality and cloud deployment to make the pipeline completely scalable."
